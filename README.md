# WELCOME TO THE MIND PALACE APP!

A Mind Palace (or "method of loci") is an ancient tool to enhance memory
using familiar spacial locations.  By visualizing a path through a well-known
location, and committing a primary list of immovable objects (the loci) to 
memory, the user could theoretically attach a secondary list of objects to the 
primary list, thereby improving the ability to recall the second (more unfamiliar)
list.

This app requires 2 terminals.  
- After cloning this app from gitHub, open terminal 1 & cd into "backend"
  a. run "bundle install"
  b. run "rails s" to start your local server.
- open terminal 2 & cd into "frontend"; run "open index.html"

To explore this app:
- Use the "Create Your Palace" submit form to give your Palace a name
  which correspods to a location you know well (ex: "My Apartment").
- With the mouse, click on areas in the black square (which will turn grey)
  to draw an aerial view of the location.
- Underneath your Palace name, click the "See Me" button
- Identify items in your location that are well known to you and do not move
  (ex:  "Doorknob", "Mirror", "Bookshelf").  These will be your Loci.
- Identify items that you would like to remember (ex: the name of my nieces/nephews). 
  These will be your Items.
- Add Loci & Items to your Palace.
- Use the "Go Back" button to return to the index page.
- To delete a Loci/Item pair, click on the "x" to the right of that pair.
- If a Palace has no Loci/Item pairings, you may delete the Palace name 
  by clicking on the name itself

Things to note:
- Currently the "Save Map" button on the Palace show page has no functionality.
- Currently the "x" buttons next to the Loci/Item pairs on the show page have
  no functionality.
